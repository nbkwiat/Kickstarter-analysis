# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This Project is an analysis of two things, Outcomes Based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals. These have been specifically looked in the the "Theater" category and the "Plays" subcategory. 

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to compare various Theater campaign's launch dates and fundraising goals. Doing this will allow us to understand the right qualities to have the best chance of a successful campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges
I performed this analysis by looking specifically at Launch Dates and Goals of Theater campaigns. Using pivot tables and charts I clearly can show when the most succesful launch date is and if the funding affects the production at all. There are other various factors that can be looked at as well, such as if country of origin, catagory, and subcatagory play any role in the outcome. 

Some challenges that came about were specifically with one graph. On my "Outcomes Based on Goals" chart, which you will see later in this analysis, The right percentages are formulated out in the excel sheet, however the graph didnt populate the line graph in the right spot. I will point this out later again in my analysis. Another possible challenge that could arise is some of these data sets are so large that some formulas will be very complex and the slightest mistype could skew the data. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For Outcomes Based on Launch Dates, the data shows that May is the most successful month to launch a campaign. There are possibly other reasons why this is true but the graph attached in this section shows that the most successful Theater campaigns come from a launch date in May. each month after that is less and less successful while appearing that the winter months have the least likelyhood of success. I can conclude from this data that if someone is trying to launch a successful Theater campaign the best time to do it is in May.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
For Outcomes Based on Goals, the data shows that the most successful Theater campaigns have a goal of less that $1000. This was very surprising but this doesnt account for the actual number of money pledged and recieved. The data also shows that the projects that failed more often have a goal of $25,000-$29,000.

***Looking at the graph below, the "failed" and "canceled" campaign numbers didnt properly populate. I believe this is just a limit of the computational power of excel because formating and numbers, in the sheet where the data is being pulled, is accurate.***

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The only real difficulty I ran into was the issue with the "Outcomes vs Goals" graph I have explained above. Some possible challenges I can see occuring would be a skew in data throwing off percentages. Another challenge I can see occuring is not filtering the subcategory collum properly when trying to figure out the Outcomes Based on Goals. 
## Results

**- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
1. May is the most successful month to launch a campaign.
2. The Winter months are the least successful months to launch a campaign.

**- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
1. Having a low goal will help the chances of success.

**- What are some limitations of this dataset?**

There are multiple limitations to this dataset. For one, The categorys range from a number of forms of entertainment. Having this large of a dataset can increase the amount of issues that we run into when filtering to find a specific category of information. another limitation to this data set is that the data as a whole is skewed to the right. While this may not affect the specific categorys we are looking for, it is something to consider when creating other analysis's based on this data.

**- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**

Some other tables/graphs that can be made are the success of campaigns based on genre. We looked at Theater Plays for our analysis but diving further into what genre the plays are apart of could impact the success. Another table/graph we could make is Which Country has the most successful campaigns. This data set is so large that there are a very large amount of conclusions that could be drawn from Kickstarter Campaigns.
